            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p><em>Holdin' me back,<br>
            Gravity's holdin' me back,</em><br>
            I want you to hold out the palm of your hand,<br>
           <q> Why don't we leave it at that?</q><br>
           <em> Nothin' to say</em>,When everything gets in the way, <br>
            Seems you cannot be replaced,<br>
            And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh<br>
        
        
        </p>

            

            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p><em>In this world, it's just us,<br>
            You know it's not the same as it was,<br>
            In this world, it's just us,<br>
            You know it's not the same as it was,<br>
            As it was, as it was,<br> You know it's not the same</em></p>

            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p><strong> Answer the phone,</strong><br>
           <em> "Harry, you're no good alone<br>
            Why are you sitting at home on the floor?<br>
            What kind of pills are you on?"</em><br>
            Ringin' the bell , and nobody's coming to help<br>
            <u>Your daddy lives by himself,</u><br>
            He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh,<br>

        </p>

            

            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p><em>In this world, it's just us,<br>
                You know it's not the same as it was,<br>
                In this world, it's just us,<br>
                You know it's not the same as it was,<br>
                As it was, as it was,<br> You know it's not the same</em></p>


            <h3>Bridge</h3>
            <p><u>Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet,</u><br>
            I don't wanna talk about the way that it was,<br>
            Leave America, two kids follow her,<br>
            I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first.</p>

            
            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p><em>(Hey)</em><br>
                As it was,<br>
               <q> You know it's not the same as it was,</q><br>
                As it was, as it was.</p>
